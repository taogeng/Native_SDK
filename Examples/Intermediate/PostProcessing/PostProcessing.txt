:FullDescription:
This training course demonstrates a simple implementation of a 'bloom' post processing effect, using multiple PVRApi Render Passes to apply the postprocessing. The bright parts of the picture are extracted in lower resolution in a post processing step, blurred and then added over the final image to create a glow around the object's borders.

:APIS:
OpenGL ES 2.0

:Controls:

	-	Up/Down	-	Increase/Decrease bloom intensity
