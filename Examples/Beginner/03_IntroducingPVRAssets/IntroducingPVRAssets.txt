:FullDescription:
This training course introduces the PowerVR Framework PVRAssets library, and shows how to use it to read a PowerVR Object Data (.pod) file and textures.  It goes into detail on how to open .pod files, .pvr files that have been referenced by it, and set up the cameras and lights from the .pod file. This demo also demonstrates the use of PVRNativeApi (either Vulkan or OpenGL ES), which is the API binding used in the native parts of this this SDK.
