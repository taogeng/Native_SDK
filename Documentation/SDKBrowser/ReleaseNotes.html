			<h2>PowerVR Tools and SDK 2016 R1</h2>
				<h3><strong>PowerVR Tools and SDK 2016 R1.2</strong></h3>
				<h3>PowerVR SDK v4.1.2</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>Fixed a bug in iOS touch input where it could sometimes be very difficult to register a touch due to very small allowed pixel distance.</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug in the VulkanBumpmap example where Samplers were local and allowed to be destroyed while still in use.</li>
				<li>Changed the SwapInterval / VSync strategy to map better between OpenGL and Vulkan. The -vsync command line parameter now works with either (On, Off, Relaxed, Mailbox, Half) methods, or with SwapInterval numbers of (0,1,2,-1). Half is not usually supported on Vulkan (and will map to On), Mailbox is not usually supported in OGLES (and will map to Off)</li>
				<li>The Framework static library prebuild binaries are no longer packaged with the SDK to reduce package size.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>PVRTune v14.141.1</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>New PVRScope API: PVRScopeReadTimingData(). This function can be called periodically if you wish to access the start and end times of tasks running on the GPU. The first time this function is called will enable the feature; from then on data will be stored. If you wish to call this function once only at the end of a test run, call it once also prior to the test run.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>PVRShaman v2.3.1</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>Fixed failure to start on OS X due to missing QT library.</li>
				</ul>
			<h3><strong>PowerVR Tools and SDK 2016 R1.1</strong></h3>
			<h3>PowerVR SDK v4.1.1</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>Re-introduced and enhanced workaround for EGL context report on systems that claim overoptimistic capabilities.</li>
				<li>Fixed a memory corruption issue that could occur if the Context was not freed before exit.</li>
				<li>Fixed a double-delete bug and made the object wrapper destructors more defensive.</li>
				<li>Changed Linux builds default optimization level from O3 to O2 as this was causing instabilities with some GCC versions. This fixes pre-built demo binaries for Linux.</li>
				<li>SDKBrowser: Updated ReleaseNotes to reflect 2016 R1 and R1.1 releases.</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>PVRVFrame v10.3.1</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>Fixed "strict" mode being too strict, which caused issues on some AMD graphic cards.</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>Installer</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>Updated Windows signature to SHA-2. This will stop the “The signature is corrupt or invalid” message.</li>
				</ul>
			<<h3><strong>PowerVR Tools and SDK 2016 R1</strong></h3>
			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>In our first release of 2016, we have provided a host of new fixes and updates – including a fully functioning Vulkan backend for the PVR Framework. The Framework itself consists of a light-weight abstraction layer, as well as utility functions, that provide explicit control of Vulkan whilst reducing the amount of code required to render a scene. It features, among other things: utilities for common tasks, such as object creation and asset uploading (e.g. mesh loading & pipeline baking), simplified object lifetime management, and cross-platform setup. It also includes the GnomeHorde demo, specifically created to show multi-threaded command buffer management for Vulkan.</p>

			<h2>PowerVR Tools and SDK v4.0</h2>
			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>In this release, we aim to ease developers into the new generation of graphics APIs with our new Framework. It is a completely re-written cross-platform and cross-API framework which functions as scaffolding around which to build your own rendering or game engine. In addition to this, we have improved all of our utilities, though PVRTrace is the utility which has had the most changes – not only does it feature a large number of bug-fixes and back-end enhancements, but also a redesigned Scrubber for much improved Image Analysis. PVRTrace now also supports the Android Extension Pack. It also bears mentioning that PVRHub now is compatible with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, and it has been redesigned to support Android TV.</p>

			<h2>PowerVR Tools and SDK v3.4</h2>
			<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>In this release PVRShaderEditor adds the latest compilers for Series6, Series6 FP16, and Series6XT to provide more up-to-date profiling. PVRShaderEditor also adds new functionality to access the GLSL disassembly for these compilers, as well as full instruction set documentation. In addition, several performance optimizations have been made for the different utilities in the PowerVR Tools suite. New SDKs have been added including WebGL, Android 64bit and Linux MIPS. Furthermore, a fully redesigned PowerVR SDK Browser is now supplied with the distribution for improving accessibility of the SDK contents.</p>

			<h3>PVRVTune v14.88</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Renamed TA to Tiler, and 3D to Renderer.</li>
					<li>Added counters:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Shader proportion: pixel.</li>
						<li>Shader proportion: vertex.</li>
						<li>Shader proportion: compute.</li>
						<li>Vertices per batch.</li>
						<li>Shader slot scheduled count: compute.</li>
						<li>Shader slot scheduled count: pixel.</li>
						<li>Shader slot scheduled count: vertex.</li>
						<li>Shader slot size: pixel.</li>
						<li>Shader slot size: vertex.</li>
						<li>GPU task time per frame: Tiler core.</li>
						<li>GPU task time per frame: Renderer core.</li>
						<li>GPU task time per frame: 2D core.</li>
						<li>GPU task time per frame: Compute core.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Complete build and custom counter groups:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Custom counters: editable fourth column.</li>
						<li>Rename the count modes "unary" and "binary".</li>
						<li>Added a filter input box for the first three columns.</li>
						<li>Set the stretch factors to give the rightmost two columns more space.</li>
						<li>Removed uniformItemSizes for the first list. That also affects width, which means the horizontal scroll bar wasn't appearing soon enough.</li>
						<li>Fixed tab order, and put the focus in the filter box by default.</li>
						<li>Now saves and restores the dialog's geometry each time.</li>
						<li>Now create counters for custom HW sources.</li>
						<li>BVNC string parsing. Should now handle V="cb" or V="3p" style BVNCs. When automatically creating per frame and per second counters for HW sources, now also creates a per clock counter.</li>
						<li>When automatically creating per frame and per second counters for HW sources, now also creates a raw counter. This lets you see the actual count in the time period. Perhaps useful in the counter table, but not in the graph.</li>
						<li>SGX XT counter: "Shader load: Compute".</li>
						<li>New counter: Batches per frame.</li>
						<li>New counter: Shader proportion: event.</li>
						<li>PVRTune regression fix: Counter Table group combo box now correctly displays the chosen group.</li>
						<li>Fixed some counter sources not being visible after choosing them in a custom group.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<p>PVRTuneGUI</p>
				<ul>
					<li>PID docking-window: fixed occasional disappearance of known application names (they are only received if PVRPerfServer is run with the -pid option).</li>
					<li>Monitor docking-window:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Data no longer "pauses" during periods of no GPU activity.</li>
						<li>Added the missing shader core load, for Rogue.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Counter properties docking-window:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>No longer lets the window size grow due to a long counter Name or Source string.</li>
						<li>Also sets the Name and Source strings as StatusTips (ToolTips are too distracting) - allows larger strings be read.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Added support for nested user timelines. PVRTune renders these as a "flame graph".</li>
					<li>Connection screen:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>URL buttons now automatically shrink their text to fit (lost during port to Qt).</li>
						<li>"Connect To:" box now gets the focus by default, as it should, and as it used to. Can once again simply run and press Enter to go straight to the last connection.</li>
						<li>Now convert all file path slashes to '/'. This fixes/removes the possibility of two 'matching' paths in the file history but with different slashes on Windows.</li>
						<li>Status bar: now has a visual semaphore indicating connection warnings; click to show the PVRPerfServer Details dialog box.</li>
						<li>Added more feedback to PVRPerfServer details: now shows warnings at the bottom.</li>
						<li>Complete build: additional info.</li>
						<li>Fixed some rare crashes.</li>
						<li>Main window: fixed the 'empty window' behind the splash screen during first (no preferences file) start up.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Changed the default docking-window layout:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Top Dock left to right: counter table (default top-most), search, remote editor.</li>
						<li>Bottom: Monitor (default top-most), Props, RS override, PID.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Mouse hover over the Monitor now causes counters to highlight. Also, in the bar chart style, empty components will now have a hit-test result.</li>
					<li>The Counter Table context menu now has a new option "Properties", which enables and brings the Counter Properties docking window foremost, and sets the focus to the Y-Axis input box.</li>
					<li>Graphs:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Graphs now scroll more smoothly even when received data is intermittent.</li>
						<li>Fixed an issue where start-up with a zoom value of one (1) would mean that the mouse-wheel could not be used to zoom out, but other methods could.</li>
						<li>Fixed vertical centering of timeline labels on Windows and Linux.</li>
						<li>Renderstate Override: sets vertical policy to preferred, rather than fixed. Makes it a much more polite docking window.</li>
						<li>Fixed a case where scrolled graph rendering could show pixel corruption (refresh would fix).</li>
					</ul>
					<li>PVRTune performance optimisations.</li>
					<li>Bug-fix: restore proper counter tool-tips.</li>
					<li>Updated PVRTuneComplete's welcome message in light of it being covered by the NDA licence, rather than the DDK source licence.</li>
					<li>No longer remember zoom or position between sessions. When loading from a file, automatically "view all" when complete.</li>
					<li>New icons.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>PVRPerfServer</p>
			<ul>
				<li>PVRPerfServer command-line:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>All non-single-character commands must now be prefixed with two dashes, e.g. --pid rather than -pid.</li>
					<li>Added new command line option quit after time (qat) e.g. "--qat=4.2" which commands PVRPerfServer to auto-quit after a time of 4.2 seconds.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>PVRPerfServer for Linux, BB10 and Android: made unnecessary and removed command line option "--disable-user-input".</li>
			</ul>
			<p>PVRScope Library</p>
			<ul>
				<li>PVRScopeComms.h:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Don't prefix strings with psz (thereby specifying NULL-terminated), when in fact there is a string-length parameter. pplSendMark() comment improved: the input string is not time-stamped, it's done internally.</li>
					<li>New class: CPPLProcessingScoped. Helper class which will send a processing begin/end pair around its scope. You would typically instantiate these at the top of a function or after the opening curly-brace of a new scope within a function.</li>
					<li>PVRScopeComms.h: updated comments; pplSendProcessingBegin() / pplSendProcessingEnd() pairs can now be nested.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>PVRScope: Headers should work with C code.</li>
				<li>PVRScopeReadCountersThenSetGroup(): removed nTimeUS parameter as it is now queried internally.</li>
				<li>Split PVRScopeReadCountersThenSetGroup() into two new functions: PVRScopeReadCounters() and PVRScopeSetGroup().</li>
				<li>PVRScopeStats: new function PVRScopeFindStandardCounter().</li>
				<li>Fix for per-render counters (per-frame were ok).</li>

					<li>Added data compression for trace files to reduce their size.</li>
					<li>PVRTrace will now output an error message if you attempt to load a trace file with a file format newer than the latest format recognised.</li>
					<li>PVRTrace files are no longer allowed to have ':' in their name. This caused issues when recording on Android where it is allowed and trying to pull the file on to Windows where it isn't.</li>

					<li>PVRTrace now includes full recording capabilities on Android 4.4 (KiKat) and the handling of Android Native Buffers has been improved. Developers also now benefit from enhanced search and remote recording capabilities and complete support for OpenGL ES 3.0 API.</li>
					<li>PVRTune implements a new ‘monitor’ window which provides a simplified and high-level overview of CPU, memory and graphics loading, allowing developers to quickly isolate application bottlenecks. It also has improved highlight and selection capabilities and implements new per-PID stats.</li>
					<li>In addition, the SDK’s documentation has been comprehensively reviewed and updated.</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>Note</h3>
			Full support for the recently ratified OpenGL ES 3.1 API has been added to PVRVFrame. Please note that this support is only intended for early development, as an OpenGL ES 3.1 conformance test has not yet been released. To use it, please download the header files from the Khronos website. We will shortly release a full SDK highlighting the most important features of this new API.
			<h3>Examples</h3>
				<ul>

					<li>PVRPerfServer can now send CPU usage info for 'interesting' PIDs that it sees: apps that connect via PVRScope, PIDs shown in HWPerf timing data, and PIDs specified on the command line. To enable it, specify "-pid" on the command line. To additionally watch specific PIDs, specify "-pid=A,B" etc.</li>
					<li>Added per-core task time counters.</li>
					<li>Added per-PID stats: TA Busy %, 3D Busy %, 2D Busy %, Compute Busy %, 3D SPM %.</li>

					<li>Fixed: When connecting, disconnecting and reconnecting, pause was enabled by default.</li>
					<li>Search window
					<ul>
						<li>The "select" tick box has been removed.</li>
						<li>Mouse-over search results now highlights the relevant time range (if any) in the graph views.</li>
						<li>Single-click on a result now pans the view, rather than panning + zooming.</li>
						<li>Double-click on a result now pans and zooms the view.</li>
						<li>Holding the Ctrl key while doing either of the above also selects the time range. (Similar to how Ctrl+click in a graph view is used to alter the selected time range).</li>
						<li>Hold Ctrl+Shift to extend the existing selection.</li>
						<li>Added View\Find - Ctrl+F now works to bring up Search (shows, raises and sets focus to the input box).</li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Graph Views
					<ul>
						<li>Now display the highlighted time range.</li>
						<li>Ensure selection/highlight range draws are always at least 1 pixel wide.</li>
						<li>If there is a task under the mouse, highlight the entire time range.</li>
						<li>Ctrl must be held to modify the selection - don't suddenly allow Shift by itself to extend the selection.</li>
						<li>Ctrl+clicking on a task now sets the selection to be the entire task time-range - giving 'snap' behaviour. Additionally, hold Shift to instead extend the existing selection.</li>
					</ul>	
					</li>
					<li>Counter Table
					<ul>
						<li>Added a new counter table column: Highlight.</li>
						<li>Counter Table default columns are now: 1s, Selected, View.</li>
